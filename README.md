## Clickit-Drinkit

This project was built to allow users to learn how to make their favorite drinks or discover new ones. It was a collaborative effort using HTML, CSS, javaScript and jQuery to retrieve data from an API.  Whether the user is new to cocktails, or an experienced bartender, this app can be used to learn new skills or sharpen the existing repertoire.

# Using the website

Because this is a website that involves alcohol, the user is first presented with an age verification modal that confirms the age of 21 or older.  After entering date of birth, if the user is 21 or above, the submit button will send user to the homepage.

Once the homepage is reached, the user is presented with a list of cocktail images that they may choose from.  Once those images are clicked, the user will be taken to a page that displays ingrediants and instructions on how to make the chosen cocktail.  If the user would like to search for specific cocktails, they may do so by typing the cocktail name in the search bar located at the top right corner of the page.  The user can also put a type of liquor or even a single ingredient, and the API will pull cocktails that contain typed ingrediant.  Again, the user will be shown an image, ingredients, and instructions on how to make each drink.
